This site consists of a pure Jekyll installation. The graphical layer of the base theme has been modified using the Bourbon library of tools: [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) and [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/). The offcanvas navigation feature, has been adapted from the implementation of [David Bushell](http://dbushell.com/). 

The source files are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/maripac/donakis).
